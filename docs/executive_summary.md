# Personal Healthcare
## Executive Summary

### Project Overview

Personal Healthcare is an innovative web-based platform that leverages artificial intelligence and machine learning to predict and manage health risks. The application connects patients with healthcare providers and provides personalized health insights based on advanced predictive models.

### Business Value

- **Preventive Healthcare**: Identifies health risks before they become serious conditions
- **Cost Reduction**: Lowers healthcare costs through early intervention
- **Patient Engagement**: Increases patient involvement in their health journey
- **Clinical Efficiency**: Helps healthcare providers prioritize care based on risk

### Technical Innovation

The platform incorporates state-of-the-art machine learning models to predict risks for three critical health conditions:

1. **Diabetes**
2. **Heart Disease/Attack**
3. **Stroke**

Each condition is analyzed using multiple algorithm types (Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines, XGBoost, and Random Forest) to ensure high accuracy in predictions.

### Recent Enhancements

Our engineering team has recently completed several key improvements:

1. **Dependency Resolution**: Fixed build issues by adding essential dependencies, ensuring application stability and reliability.

2. **Brand Consistency**: Standardized the application name and branding to "Personal Healthcare" across all interfaces and documentation.

3. **Documentation**: Created comprehensive documentation covering the platform architecture, functionality, and future roadmap.
